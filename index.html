        <h2>Pig Game Rules</h2>
        <p>
          Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":<br>
  
          ãƒ»If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
          ãƒ»If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.<br>
          ãƒ»If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.<br>
          <br>
          The first player to score 100 or more points wins.<br>
          <br>
          For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5.<br>
          Donald could hold and score 5 points, but chooses to roll again.<br>
          Donald rolls a 2, and could hold with a turn total of 7 points, but chooses to roll again.<br>
          Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring.<br>
          The next player, Alexis, rolls the sequence 4-5-3-5-5, after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total of 22 points to her score.
